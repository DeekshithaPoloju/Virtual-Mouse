# 🖱️ Virtual Mouse

## 📌 Overview

Virtual Mouse is a computer vision project that allows users to control the mouse cursor using hand gestures through a webcam.

The project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe (via CVZone), and PyAutoGUI to recognize hand gestures and perform mouse operations without touching a physical mouse.
